# MENTORG #
Project Contails client and server both.

## Software Dependencies / Prerequisites

As mentioned above, this project has several software dependences. Depending on how you setup your development environment, you'll need the following:
1. Node (Version 18.x)
2. Your preferred text editor (I am currently uses VS Code, but this is not mandatory)

## Clone a repository

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repository command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repository](https://bitbucket.org/harshpatel92/mentorg/src/master/).

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if you’d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repository’s files.
